### Project Description
This tool lets you type in any text and see it converted into Morse code, both visually and with sound. You can adjust settings like speed, pitch, or volume to customize how the Morse code plays. It’s handy for experimenting, learning, or just having some fun with Morse messages.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
For people who can't see, they wouldn't know what they are typing. So this tool could be used to guide and keep track of what they are typing and know whether or not it makes sense.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We could listen to what we type.
